# FitnessInfo.org

## Overview

FitnessInfo.org is a Java application that calculates and provides personalized fitness recommendations for maintaining, losing, or gaining weight based on the user's gender, age, height, weight, and activity level.

## Features

- Collects user input for gender, age, activity level, height, and weight.
- Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and categorizes it (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity).
- Uses the Harris-Benedict equation to compute Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).
- Offers customized calorie recommendations for weight maintenance, mild weight loss/gain (0.5 lb/week), moderate weight loss/gain (1 lb/week), and extreme weight loss/gain (2 lb/week).
- Provides a clear summary of the user's fitness information and recommendations.

## Notes

- Ensure all input values (age, height, weight) are positive numbers.
- Activity levels are categorized as follows: 1 for sedentary, 2 for slightly active, 3 for moderately active, 4 for very active, and 5 for extremely active.
- The program assumes a basic understanding of fitness and nutrition concepts, such as BMI, BMR, and TDEE.
- Always consult with a healthcare provider or a professional before making significant changes to your diet or exercise regimen based on these recommendations.
